# Medical Image Processing Project

## Overview
This project is developed as part of my first year of a master's degree in engineering, specializing in medical and healthcare technologies. The project focuses on the development of image processing algorithms for the analysis and visualization of medical data. The Qt interface provided here is based on three OpenCV labs, demonstrating various medical image processing techniques.

## Features
Convert to Gray: Convert color images to grayscale.
Display RGB Channels: Display individual RGB channels of an image.
Invert Image: Invert the colors of an image.
